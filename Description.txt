Instructions:

Complete this problem as a team. The problem must be solved using a numerical method that was presented in class. Built-in Python functions may be used to supplement your numerical method of choice, but they may not replace it.

Your Python code must be clearly and thoroughly commented. The results should be neatly presented, with all relevant labels included.

When submitting, include the following files: the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb), the HTML file, the written report, and the field manual.

Important: Artificial intelligence and internet resources are not allowed to be used in solving this problem.

Problem Statement

Background

The goal of artillery is to fire a shell so that it successfully hits a specific target.

If we ignore the effects of air resistance, the differential equations that describe the acceleration of the shell are quite simple:

d(vx)/dt = 0

d(vz)/dt = −g

Here, vx and vz represent the velocities in the x and z directions, respectively, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

Using these equations, we can show that the shell’s trajectory is parabolic.

You are encouraged to consider and answer how this is shown before moving forward.

Once this is known, we can calculate the required initial speed, v₀, and launch angle, θ₀, above the horizontal, that will allow the shell to reach its target.

It can be shown that the maximum range is always achieved when θ₀ equals 45 degrees.

When the effects of air resistance are included, they become significant if the shell travels a large distance or has a high speed.

If we modify the equations to account for a simple model of air resistance, the governing equations become:

d(vx)/dt = −c * vx * √(vx² + vz²)

d(vz)/dt = −g − c * vz * √(vx² + vz²)

The constant c depends on the shell’s shape and density as well as the density of the air.

For this project, assume that c equals 10⁻³ per meter.

To calculate the components of the position vector, recall that velocity is the derivative of position. Therefore:

sx(t) = ∫ vx(t) dt

sz(t) = ∫ vz(t) dt

The Scenario

The year is approximately 1805, and you have been hired by Napoleon Bonaparte as an artillery officer to assist in the Battle of Ulm.

Napoleon, known for his own mathematical brilliance, recognizes you as a mathematical prodigy. He has assigned you the task of projecting artillery trajectories using numerical methods.

In this scenario, cannonballs are being fired at a target located a horizontal distance of Δx away.

As the artillery officer, you will choose the distance, for example, 0.5 miles.

Your Tasks

a) Develop a method for estimating the initial velocity, v₀, and the launch angle, θ₀, with reasonable accuracy, given the exact range to the target, Δx.

Your method should be simple enough to be used in real time on the battlefield, without a computer.

Be prepared to convince Napoleon that your numerical solution is sufficiently accurate — he will be difficult to persuade!

b) Discuss the sensitivity of your solutions to variations in the constant c.

c) Extend the problem to make it more realistic.

You must add at least one modification. A few possible extensions include:

Considering the effects of targets at different altitudes (Δz).

Considering moving targets.

Considering headwinds or tailwinds.

Considering wind coming from an angle outside of the x–z plane.

Considering firing the cannon from a boat with the target on shore — including the effect of waves.

Final Deliverables

Your completed project must include:

A technical report describing your method, written for a mathematically sophisticated audience.

A field manual that instructs an artillery officer on how to use your method.

HTML and Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files that show the solutions to parts (a) through (c).

Bon Courage!

(Good luck, and may you have courage!)
